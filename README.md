Algorithms lie at the heart of computing. We studied the design and analysis of various
algorithms. This project covers the application perspective of algorithms. How
algorithms form the basis of every computer program/application, from Facebook to the
Operating system itself. The project tries to present the conceptual map of the course
through a real world view. The project also involves implementing some of the algorithms
used in popular applications modularly as the theory tends to leave out a lot of little
implementation details that turn out not to be so little when the time comes to implement.

An algorithm is viewed as a tool for solving a well-specified computational problem and the
practical applications of algorithms are omnipresent. The following are some of the interesting examples I have covered in this project :
